        <p class="hem">The Hermes Design is one of the most fanciest and beautiful footwear worn by both the male and
            female gender.
            <br><br>There can be made with different kinds of sole like The Nora Floor Design, The Maco Floor
            Design,<br><br>
            The Nora Sole Design and many more. They are also very much expensive just like the Brinstock
            Design.<br><br>
            Depending on the colour of the design of the Hermes Design it matches or goes well with any kind of
            dress you<br><br> wish to try it out with. The price depends on the sole used. The Nora Sole,
            not that its not also
            expensive,<br><br> but it is the lowest among them while the Maco Floor Designs are the most expensive and
            the best of
            them all.<br><br><br><br>
            Lets see some pictures startingfrom the right side is a female Hermes Design<br><br> and below is a kind
            worn by the
            male gender
